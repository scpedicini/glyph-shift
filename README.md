**Transform text on web pages into different writing systems like Hiragana, Braille, and Morse Code to help you learn and practice reading these alphabets.**

Glyphshift is a browser extension that randomly replaces words with their phonetic or symbolic equivalents based on user-selected writing systems and frequency settings, creating an immersive learning experience while browsing the web.

# FAQ

## How is Glyphshift different from other language learning tools?

Unlike many other swap-based extensions, Glyphshift focuses on phonetic and symbolic systems (such as Morse code or ASL fingerspelling) rather than full languages (such as Spanish or German) - making it significantly easier to use and more accessible for quick learning and practice.

## Prior Art

Language Immersion

Polyglot
https://code.google.com/archive/p/chrome-polyglot/

MindTheWord
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mind-the-word/fabjlaokbhaoehejcoblhahcekmogbom?hl=en

Unlike the other extensions which focus more on language translation, Glyphshift focuses more on learning "writing systems" or "alphabets". These methods of communication are relatively simple and can usually be learned in a few hours. This extension is meant to be a fun way to review your knowledge of these alphabets.

# Development

## TODO

- [ ] Reference to learning resources
- [X] Vorticon alphabet

## Future Language Support

- [ ] Braille 2, aka contracted Grade 2 braille
- [X] Support for numerals in swap systems
- [ ] Cockney rhyming slang should incorporate English synonyms, base forms, etc. to make it more flexible

## Data Preparation

The extension requires pre-processed data files for various phonetic systems. If you modify the source CSV/TSV files, you must regenerate the JSON data files.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run prepare-data` - Run all data preparation scripts
- `npm run prepare-data:hiragana` - Prepare Hiragana phonetic data
- `npm run prepare-data:katakana` - Prepare Katakana loan words data
- `npm run prepare-data:cockney` - Prepare Cockney rhyming slang data

## Data Sources

### Hiragana Data
- Source files:
  - `/data-sources/combined_cmu_ipa_data.csv` - English word to IPA pronunciation mappings
  - `/data-sources/ipa-to-hiragana.csv` - IPA phoneme to Hiragana mappings
- Output: 
  - `/public/data/hiragana-word-to-ipa.json`
  - `/public/data/hiragana-ipa-to-hiragana.json`

### Katakana Data
- Source file: `/data-sources/katakana_loan_words.tsv` - Japanese loan words
- Output: `/public/data/katakana-loan-words.json`

### Cockney Rhyming Slang Data
- Source file: `/data-sources/cockney-rhyming-slang.csv` - Cockney rhyming slang mappings
- Features:
  - Supports multiple rhymes for the same word
  - Handles synonyms (comma-delimited in the Synonyms column)
  - Preserves all metadata (English, Rhyme, Cockney, Notes, Synonyms)
- Output: `/public/data/cockney-rhyming-slang.json`

**Note:** The data preparation scripts are NOT run automatically during builds. You must run them manually after any CSV/TSV modifications.
