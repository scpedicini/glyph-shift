## Vorticon Alphabet

The Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA) is a writing system used throughout the Commander Keen series. It is a simple substitution cypher, where each letter in the Latin alphabet has been substituted with a different symbol. The SGA can be used to write in different languages; however, in the games the SGA is used to write messages in the English language only.

Use the `assets/sga-k3-direct.otf.woff2` font file to display the SGA characters in the extension. Implementation should be nearly identical to the Morse code swapper since its just a different font for A-Z/a-z characters.
