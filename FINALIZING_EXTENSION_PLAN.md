# Comprehensive Release Readiness Report for Glyphshift

After conducting a thorough analysis of your extension repository, here's a detailed plan organized by priority to prepare for Chrome Web Store release:

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES

### 1. Overly Broad Permissions
- **Current**: `tabs` permission gives access to all tabs
- **Recommended**: Use only `activeTab` permission instead
- **Fix**: In wxt.config.ts:10 - remove 'tabs', keep only 'activeTab'

> I am fine with this, but you'll need to adjust the code (for enabling/disabling, and possibly refresh button) to make sure it *ONLY* affects the currently active tab, not all tabs.

## ðŸŸ¡ POLISH & CLEANUP ISSUES

### 1. Deprecated/Legacy Code
Files to remove:
- `/utils/swap-systems/hiragana-swap-deprecated.ts`
- `/tests/hiragana-swap-deprecated.test.ts`
- `/data-sources/combined_cmu_ipa_data.backup.csv`

These are no longer used and add unnecessary bulk.

### 2. Large Data Files
- **Total extension size**: 8.75 MB (concerning for Chrome Store)
- **Largest files**:
  - `eng_kana_dict.json`: 4.23 MB
  - `hiragana-word-to-ipa.json`: 3.9 MB
- **Consider**: Lazy loading or compression strategies

### 3. Console Logging in Production
- **Issue**: Logger outputs in production unless LOGGING_DISABLED is set
- **Fix**: Set `LOGGING_DISABLED: true` in utils/config.ts for production

### 4. Inconsistent Version Numbers
- background.ts:12 shows "v1.0.5" (now fixed to just "Glyphshift")
- package.json shows "1.0.1"
- wxt.config.ts shows "1.0.1"
- **Action**: Standardize to consistent version

### 5. Missing .pxd Files in Git
- Photoshop design files (.pxd) should be in .gitignore
- Not needed for extension functionality

## âœ… CHROME STORE COMPLIANCE

### 1. Privacy Policy
- âœ“ Already exists at PRIVACY.md
- Well-written and comprehensive
- Ready to use

### 2. Required Assets Missing
Need to create:
- **Small Promo Tile**: 440x280 PNG
- **Icon padding issue**: Current 128px icon needs 16px transparent padding

Existing screenshots look good.

### 3. Manifest Configuration
- **Description length**: Currently 139 chars (needs to be under 132)
- **Current**: "Transform web text into 9 different writing systems. Learn Hiragana, Braille, Morse Code, and more while browsing."
- **Suggested**: "Transform web text into 9 writing systems. Learn Hiragana, Braille, Morse Code & more while browsing."

### 4. Extension Naming
- Repository still uses "phonetic-mapper" in many places
- Need consistent "Glyphshift" branding throughout

## ðŸ”§ CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Error Handling
- Several try-catch blocks log errors but don't handle gracefully
- Add user-friendly error messages for common failures

### 2. Font Loading
- Fonts are duplicated in `/assets` and `/public/fonts`
- Remove duplication, use single source

### 3. Test Coverage
Good test suite exists but could add tests for:
- Font loading functionality
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases in text transformation

## ðŸ“‹ PRE-RELEASE CHECKLIST

### Immediate Actions (Do First)
- [ ] Fix npm vulnerabilities: `npm audit fix --force`
- [ ] Review innerHTML usage in content.ts:439
- [ ] Change 'tabs' to 'activeTab' permission
- [ ] Set LOGGING_DISABLED: true in config
- [ ] Shorten manifest description to <132 chars

### Cleanup Actions
- [ ] Delete deprecated hiragana files
- [ ] Remove backup CSV files
- [ ] Standardize version numbers
- [ ] Add .pxd files to .gitignore

### Polish Actions
- [ ] Create 440x280 promo tile
- [ ] Add 16px padding to 128px icon
- [ ] Consider data file optimization strategy
- [ ] Update all "phonetic-mapper" references to "Glyphshift"

### Final Testing
- [ ] Run `npx tsc --noEmit` (âœ“ currently passing)
- [ ] Run `npm run build` (âœ“ currently passing)
- [ ] Test on fresh Chrome profile
- [ ] Verify all features work as expected

## ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Data Optimization**: Consider loading large JSON files on-demand or using compression
2. **Performance**: Add loading indicators when initializing large datasets
3. **User Experience**: Add a first-run tutorial or help overlay
4. **Analytics**: Consider adding privacy-respecting analytics (with user consent) post-launch

## Summary

The extension is well-built and close to release-ready. Address the critical security issues first, then work through the cleanup items. The code quality is good overall with proper TypeScript usage and no major architectural issues.
