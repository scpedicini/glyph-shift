# eng_10k_common_to_kana.json

Contains the most frequently occurring English words (10k) mapped to their corresponding Katakana representations.

```json
{
    "the": ["ゼ", "ジー"],
    "be": ["ビー"],
    // ... more entries ...
}
```

Although this file uses Katakana, it is actually used in the HiraganaSwap module which immediately converts the Katakana to Hiragana. This is because these kana representations were autogenerated using phonetic rules and are not actual Katakana words.

# cockney-rhyming-slang.json

```json
{
    "phone": [
        {
            "english":"phone",
            "rhyme":"dog and bone",
            "cockney":"dog and bone",
            "notes":"known but rarely used outside tv",
            "synonyms":"telephone, cellphone, smartphone"
        }
    ],
    // ... more entries ...
}
```

# true-katakana-mappings.json

This is used by the TrueKanaSwap module to map English words to their true Katakana representations, which are used in Japanese language contexts. `isTransliteration` indicates whether the Katakana is a direct transliteration of the English word or not.

```json
  "disposable towels": [
    {
      "isTransliteration": false,
      "katakana": "キッチンペーパー"
    }
  ],
  "coffee": [
    {
      "isTransliteration": true,
      "katakana": "コーヒー"
    }
  ],
  // ... more entries ...
}
```
